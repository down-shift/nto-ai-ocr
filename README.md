# Optical Character Recognition for NTO AI 2022 finals

This repository contains the code for recognition of handwritten text. The project was created for the finals of AI National Technological Olympiad in collaboration with [@zaborshikov](https://github.com/zaborshikov). The baseline was provided by Sber AI.

First, we had to split the image into separate words, as shown on the example:

Then, each word would be recognized by OCR algorithm:
